# A simple Discord bot by a python learner to python learners.

Feel free to contact me for more informations or to participate
in the developping of the project. 

This bot is intended to learn about python and how to develop
bots on Discord. If you are to participate, please note that
this is the main idea where we share the knowledge so people
can learn with exemples and make experiences on their own.

- Open a terminal (Start > run > cmd)
